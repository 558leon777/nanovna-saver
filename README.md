NanoVNASaver
============
A multiplatform tool to save Touchstone files from the NanoVNA, sweep frequency spans in segments to gain more than
101 data points, and generally display and analyze the resulting data.

Copyright 2019 Rune B. Broberg

## Introduction
This software connects to a NanoVNA and extracts the data for display on a computer, and for saving to Touchstone files.

Current features:
- Reading data from a NanoVNA
- Splitting a frequency range into multiple segments to increase resolution (tried up to >10k points)
- Displaying data on multiple chart types, such as Smith, LogMag, Phase and VSWR-charts, for both S11 and S21
- Displaying markers, and the impedance, VSWR etc. at these locations
- Exporting and importing 1-port and 2-port Touchstone files
- TDR function (measurement of cable length)
- Display of both an active and a reference trace
- Live updates of data from the NanoVNA, including for multi-segment sweeps
- In-application calibration, including compensation for non-ideal calibration standards
- Customizable display options

	    $ brew install python

3. NanoVNASaver Installation

	    $ git clone https://github.com/mihtjel/nanovna-saver && cd nanovna-saver
	    $ python3 setup.py install
	    $ NanoVNASaver

## Using the software

Connect your NanoVNA to a serial port, and enter this serial port in the serial port box.  If the NanoVNA is
connected before the application starts, it should be automatically detected. Click "Connect to NanoVNA" to connect.

The app can collect multiple segments to get more accurate measurements. Enter the number of segments to be done in the
"Segments" box. Each segment is 101 data points, and takes about 1.5 seconds to complete.

Marker frequencies are entered in Hz, or suffixed with k or M.  Scientific notation (6.5e6 for 6.5MHz) also works.
The marker readout boxes show the actual frequency where the values are taken.  Marker readouts can be hidden using the
"hide data" button when not needed.

Display settings are available under "Display setup". These allow changing the chart colours, the application font size
and which graphs are displayed.  The settings are saved between program starts.

#### Calibration
In-application calibration is available, either assuming ideal standards, or with relevant standard correction. To
calibrate, sweep each standard in turn, and press the relevant button in the calibration window. After applying the
calibration, you may save it by entering a file location and name, and pressing "Save calibration".  Conversely, a
saved calibration can be loaded. The file location and name is saved between program starts.

#### TDR
To get accurate TDR measurements, calibrate the device, and attach the cable to be measured at the calibration plane -
ie. at the same position where the calibration load would be attached.
